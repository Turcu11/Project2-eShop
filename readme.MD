## Project 2, eShop platform - Turcu Iosif

Design patterns I've used:
* **Composite**   design pattern for the products, and I've done it in a way that will allow me keep those products in boxes, and to get the full price of a box no matter what's in it or how many smaller boxes it contains
* **Mediator** for the communication between the sellers and customers, they will be able to communicate only trough the store entity
* **Singleton** for the eShop object, because I want to eliminate any confusion there is only one store on this app
*
